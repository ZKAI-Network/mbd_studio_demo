# MBD Studio Demo

**[Embed](https://getembed.ai/)** makes your wallet, agent, or social app feel more personal with AI-powered recommendations. Deliver real-time, personalized feeds for content, swaps, and bets — directly inside your app, via one simple API. Built for low spam, high signal.

Browse, remix, and create onchain feeds around social posts, content coins, prediction markets, and digital art. Embed’s algorithms predict your users’ next onchain action by combining their social graph activity with personal onchain history. The platform is spam-proof, combines onchain and offchain data, and keeps users engaged with fresh, tailored content.

This repo contains examples and demos for the **MBD Studio SDK** — the backend client for building custom recommendation pipelines: search → features → scoring → ranking.
